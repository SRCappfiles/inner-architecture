        narrative: "Something in you learned early that the world requires attention. Not because you're anxious \u2014 because at some point, paying close attention was the smartest thing you could do. It kept you intact.\n\nYou likely have a finely calibrated radar for shifts in tone, for the space between what people say and what they mean, for the mood of a room before anyone's spoken. People might call you guarded, but that's not quite right. You're not hiding. You're scanning. There's a difference.\n\nThe strategy that protected you was simple and brilliant: if I can see it coming, it can't catch me off guard. And it worked. It got you here. The question isn't whether that strategy was smart \u2014 it absolutely was. The question is whether you still need it running at full volume in rooms that aren't actually dangerous.\n\nWhat becomes possible when the sentinel in you is allowed to rest \u2014 not because the world has become safe, but because you have become someone who can handle what comes?"
      },
      deep: {
        essence: "Your nervous system learned early that the world is a place where things break without warning — and it never fully stood down.",
        narrative: "Something happened that taught your body \u2014 not your mind, your body \u2014 that the world can break its promises without notice. Maybe it was loud. Maybe it was the quiet kind, where the danger wore a familiar face. Either way, your system made a decision: never again. Never unguarded. Never fully here, because being fully here once cost you something you couldn't afford to lose twice.\n\nThe architecture you built was sophisticated. Hypervigilance that reads a room before you've finished walking through the door. A dissociation switch that pulls you out of your body when the signals overwhelm. Rage that functions as a perimeter fence. Numbness that isn't the absence of feeling but the refusal of it \u2014 because the feelings, if you let them in, would be unmanageable.\n\nThese aren't symptoms. They're engineering. The hypervigilance kept you ahead of someone unpredictable. The dissociation let you survive things that were unsurvivable if you stayed present. The rage drew a line someone else had erased. The numbness turned down a signal that would have overwhelmed the system entirely.\n\nThe cost became apparent later. You can't selectively numb \u2014 when you turn down pain, you turn down everything. You can't stay vigilant forever without the vigilance itself becoming what exhausts you. You can't rage at every breach without eventually standing alone inside the walls.\n\nBut the system did what it was supposed to do. It kept you alive. The question now isn't whether it's broken \u2014 it isn't. The question is whether the emergency is still happening, or whether what's running is the echo of an emergency that ended long ago."

      adultArrival: "You walk into a room and notice you're scanning — and for the first time, you put it down. Not because the world became safe. Because you became someone who can handle what comes. The alarm is still there. It's just no longer running you. You respond to what's actually happening instead of what once happened. And in the space where hypervigilance used to live, you find something unexpected: presence. The ability to be here — fully, without exit strategy — and discover that here is enough.",
      adultVision: "Conversations where you say what you think without rehearsing it. Sleep that comes without running contingency plans. Intimacy that doesn't require a risk assessment. A body that knows the difference between discomfort and danger — and can stay present for both."
    },

      childTruth: "The world broke its promise and my body decided: never again. Never unguarded. Never fully here. Being present nearly destroyed me once. I won't give it a second chance.",
      protectorStrategy: "Build the fortress. Hypervigilance to stay ahead, dissociation to escape what you can't stay ahead of, rage to enforce the perimeter, numbness to turn the volume down on what gets through anyway. Make no exceptions. Trust nothing fully. The cost is everything — but the alternative was unsurvivable.",
      adultArrival: "You discover the emergency ended — maybe years ago — and you survived it. The fortress doesn't come down. It gets windows. You learn to feel without drowning, to be present without being destroyed, to let someone reach you without losing yourself. Your body begins to distinguish memory from reality — the echo of danger from danger itself. You sleep differently. You breathe differently. You stop scanning the room and start inhabiting it.",
      adultVision: "A body that can rest. Relationships where closeness doesn't trigger evacuation. The ability to feel grief, joy, tenderness — the full spectrum — without the system shutting down. Presence that doesn't cost you your safety. Safety that doesn't cost you your life."
    }

  love: {
    moderate: {
      childTruth: "Love can shift without warning. If I don't track it constantly, I'll miss the moment it leaves — and by then it will be too late.",
      protectorStrategy: "Read what they need. Become it. Close every gap before it becomes a distance. If I manage the connection perfectly — if I'm attentive enough, useful enough, easy enough — I won't be left alone with the unbearable.",
      adultArrival: "You stop managing and start being. Not performing connection — experiencing it. You express a need without scanning their face for the cost. You sit in silence without filling it. And you discover that the people who stay when you stop performing are the ones who were actually there for you. The love you've been frantically earning was already available — you just couldn't receive it while your hands were full earning it.",
      adultVision: "Relationships where you bring your actual self — preferences, needs, inconveniences, the whole unedited person — and discover that some people don't just tolerate that, they prefer it. Stillness with another person that feels like rest instead of danger. The experience of being chosen, not for your usefulness, but for you."
    },
    deep: {
      childTruth: "Love is survival. Its withdrawal isn't disappointing — it's annihilating. I will erase myself, perform endlessly, or leave first. Whatever prevents the devastation of being truly left — because that cannot happen again.",
      protectorStrategy: "Become indispensable so they can't afford to leave. Disappear into their needs so there's nothing to reject. Or leave first — sever every connection at the threshold of real depth — because depth means dependence and dependence means devastation. Manage the field. Never just be in it.",
      adultArrival: "You show up as yourself — the whole, unedited, inconvenient self — and some people stay. Not because you earned it. Because they chose you. Connection stops being a project you manage and becomes a place you live. You tolerate the uncertainty of being loved without controlling the outcome — and discover that love freely given, even with its risks, nourishes in a way that earned love never could. The ache for belonging doesn't vanish. But it quiets, because belonging is no longer something you perform. It's something you allow.",
      adultVision: "The experience of being fully known by another person — not the curated version, not the useful version, but the real one — and discovering that known-ness doesn't lead to abandonment. It leads to intimacy. The ability to need someone without the need being an emergency. Love that doesn't require vigilance to maintain."

      childTruth: "My value is conditional. It must be earned every day, maintained without lapse, and defended against any evidence to the contrary. Rest is a luxury I haven't qualified for.",
      protectorStrategy: "Outwork the question. Achieve until the verdict is buried under so much evidence that it can't surface. Deflect praise because receiving it means you might relax. Never stop proving — because the moment you stop is the moment the truth gets through.",
      adultArrival: "You rest — and nothing collapses. A mistake becomes just a mistake, not a referendum on your existence. You receive a compliment and something in you lets it land, without deflecting or explaining it away. The engine that ran on 'not enough' begins to idle, and in the quiet you discover what the engine was drowning out: you were always enough. The trial you spent your life preparing for was adjourned before you were born. The performance was running in an empty courtroom.",
      adultVision: "Work that comes from desire instead of desperation. The ability to finish something and feel satisfied — not for a moment before the bar resets, but genuinely. A mistake that doesn't trigger a multi-day campaign of redemption. The experience of mattering — not because of what you've produced, but because of what you are."
    },
    deep: {
      childTruth: "I am the problem. Not what I do — what I am. This isn't a fear or a worry. It's the ground I stand on. A verdict delivered so early and reinforced so completely that it doesn't feel like a belief. It feels like the one honest thing I know about myself.",
      protectorStrategy: "Never stop earning — achieve, perfect, perform until the question of your worth is temporarily buried. Or collapse into the verdict and carry it like a stone, because at least the suffering of certainty is better than the terror of hoping. Turn the contempt inward as a preemptive strike — if you condemn yourself first, no one else's judgment can reach you. Or turn it outward — if everyone else is mediocre, your own inadequacy is relative.",
      adultArrival: "You trace the verdict to its source and discover it has an author — and the author wasn't you. The 'truth' about yourself turns out to be a conclusion drawn by a child from insufficient evidence in an uncontrolled experiment. Once you see that, the verdict doesn't vanish, but it loses jurisdiction. Self-contempt becomes self-observation. The shame, exposed to witness and daylight, loosens its grip. You stop performing your worth and begin living from it — not because someone finally convinced you you're enough, but because you questioned the court that said you weren't.",
      adultVision: "Rest that doesn't feel like dying. Stillness that doesn't feel like failure. The inner voice that used to narrate your inadequacy becoming quiet — not through force, but because it was never your voice to begin with. And the person underneath the performance — the one you were afraid to meet — turns out to have been there all along. Waiting. Intact. Enough."

  "safety-love": "Underneath the vigilance, there's an ache about belonging — and some of your safety architecture is actually in service of protecting against that loss. The scanning, the readiness, the walls: they're not just about danger. They're about making sure you're never blindsided by someone leaving. The two questions feed each other — the less safe you feel, the harder it is to trust connection; the less secure the connection, the more you scan.",
  "safety-worth": "Your safety architecture has a quiet passenger: a question about whether you deserve to feel safe at all. The hypervigilance isn't just scanning for external threat — part of it is monitoring whether you've earned the right to relax. These two questions create a particular kind of exhaustion: you can't rest because the world might be dangerous, and you can't rest because rest feels like something you haven't qualified for.",
  "love-safety": "Your attunement to connection carries a bodyguard — a safety system that activates whenever closeness gets too real. The caretaking, the shapeshifting, the relational tracking: underneath all of it is a nervous system that learned that the people you need most are also the ones who can hurt you most. Love and danger became linked early, and your architecture reflects both.",
  "love-worth": "Your question about belonging has a shadow: a suspicion that you're not worth belonging to. The performance of connection — the earning, the adapting, the making-yourself-indispensable — isn't just about preventing abandonment. It's about compensating for a quiet conviction that your unedited self wouldn't be chosen. The love question asks 'will they stay?' The worth question underneath it whispers 'why would they?'",
  "worth-safety": "Your achievement engine has a sentinel standing behind it — a part that knows what happens when you fail isn't just disappointment but danger. The relentless drive isn't pure ambition; it's partly a safety strategy. If you're excellent enough, competent enough, indispensable enough, the threats that shaped you can't reach you. Worth became your armor, and the armor became mandatory.",
  "worth-love": "Underneath the drive to prove yourself, there's a quieter ache: wanting to be valued for who you are, not what you produce. Your worth architecture may actually be running interference on your love question — keeping you so busy earning your place that you never have to risk being seen without your credentials. The performance protects against both verdicts at once: 'not enough' and 'not wanted.'"
